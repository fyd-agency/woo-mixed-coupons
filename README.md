# Woo Mixed Coupons

Woo Subscriptions only allows you to create coupons that will work either for one time purchases or subscriptions. 
Not both at the same time. This Plugins allows regular coupons to be used in both Subscription and one time only orders.

## Install
- Download the zip file
- Upload to your Woo store via /wp-admin > Plugins > Add New Plugin
- Activate the extension

## How to use
- Go to /wp-admin > Marketing > Coupons > Add Coupon
- Select one of **Percentage discount**, **Fixed cart discout** or **Fixed product discount**
- Check the option **Allow Subscriptions**
- If you want that coupon to be used only in the first cycle also check **Limit discount to the first payment** otherwise leave it unchecked
- This will make that coupon work in both subscriptions and one time purchases

## Limitations
At the moment this plugin does not work with the **Active for x payments** option it only works either for the first cycle or all cycles.
